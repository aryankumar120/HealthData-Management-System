Aim:  To develop a comprehensive and secure system for managing medical records within healthcare institutions.

Overview of the Project:
The "HealthData" project focuses on developing a cutting-edge solution for managing medical records through the utilization of a sophisticated Database Management System (DBMS). This project addresses the escalating challenges posed by the increasing volume and intricacy of medical data in modern healthcare settings. By transitioning from manual, paper-based systems to electronic health records (EHRs) and leveraging the capabilities of a DBMS, HealthData aims to enhance the storage, retrieval, and analysis of medical records while upholding stringent security and privacy standards.
